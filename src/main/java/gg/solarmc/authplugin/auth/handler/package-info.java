/**
 * Authentication is implemented using various handlers which are responsible
 * for dealing with different stages. There exists a handler for every
 * {@link gg.solarmc.authplugin.auth.Auth}. The handler for a particular
 * {@code Auth} may, when an event occurs, do one of two things: <br>
 * <br>
 * 1. Retain itself as the handler. The handler returns itself from the
 * relevant method.
 * 2. Switch the handler to another. This is done by returning a future
 * of the next handler.
